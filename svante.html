        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project involved designing and building a bench-scale test rig to evaluate a carbon capture
          process under controlled temperature conditions. The system used thermoelectric elements, heat
          spreading, insulation, and instrumentation to achieve stable plate temperatures and log data
          during experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was responsible for the mechanical layout of the temperature-control assembly, integration of
          sensors, and practical considerations around manufacturability, wiring, and repeatable setup.

            <h2>Design &amp; Integration</h2>
            <p>
              The temperature-control plate was structured as a stack-up of a heat spreader, thermoelectric
              modules, and a heat sink, clamped together with a consistent preload. I designed the plate
              geometry and mounting features to ensure good thermal contact while keeping the assembly
              manufacturable with available tooling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cut-outs and routing features were added for cable management and sensor placement. I worked
              with the electronics team to ensure adequate provisions for wiring, connectors, and clearance
              around the test area.

    <!-- Testing & Outcome -->

        <h2>Testing &amp; Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          Initial testing verified that the assembly could reach target temperatures and maintain them
          within the specified band for extended periods. The rig provided a repeatable platform for
          evaluating carbon capture samples under different thermal conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project demonstrated my ability to combine mechanical design, basic thermal considerations,
          and practical lab-level integration, while documenting the system so that other team members
          could operate and adapt it.
