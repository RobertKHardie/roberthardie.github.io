        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project involved converting a vintage Reynard IndyCar chassis to an electric powertrain.
          My primary responsibility was the design and analysis of the structural motor mount and load-bearing
          member that supports the electric motor and ties it into the existing transaxle and chassis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assembly had to maintain alignment between the motor and transaxle, handle torque and
          bump-related loading, and remain feasible to manufacture within the capabilities of a student
          team working with limited machining resources.

            <h2>Design &amp; Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              I began with a survey of the existing chassis hardpoints and transaxle mounting surfaces,
              then developed several conceptual layouts for the motor mount and supporting structure.
              After selecting a concept, I modelled the full assembly in CAD, focusing on load paths,
              stiffness, and manufacturability.
            </p>
            <p>
              FEA was used to evaluate stress and deflection under multiple load cases, including
              drive torque and vertical loads derived from vehicle mass and acceleration conditions.
              Iterations focused on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reducing stress concentrations at transitions and weld regions.</li>
              <li>Improving stiffness to limit misalignment under load.</li>
              <li>Simplifying machining and weld access where possible.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        <h2>Fabrication &amp; Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          The final design was released with detailed drawings, including critical datums and tolerances.
          Components were machined and welded according to the drawings, then trial-fit to the chassis and
          transaxle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assembly met the packaging and alignment requirements and provided a robust structure for the
          electric motor installation. This work contributed to a major milestone in the overall IndyCar
          electric conversion and established a foundation for future system integration and testing.
